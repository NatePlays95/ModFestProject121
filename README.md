[![Made for ModFest 1.21](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ModFest/art/refs/heads/v2/badge/svg/1.21/full.svg)](https://modfest.net/1.21)

A mod about finding more ancient edible crops and long-lost recipes!
You can find them in archaeology sites and through our good friends Sniffers. The recipes are new treasure items that you'll want to hold on to yourself to be able to make new foods or to trade with friends and foes in multiplayer servers. The mod also aims to add more placeable food.

## Added:
- Cassavas, Tomatoes, and Peppers as crops,
- Tapioca (Wrap), Yogurt, and Pizza recipes
- A method to make cheese
- Placeable Pizza and Roulette spicy chips
